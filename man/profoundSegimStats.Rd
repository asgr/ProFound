Image Segmentation Statistics
}
\description{
Basic summary statistics for image segments, e.g. aperture parameters, fluxes and surface brightness estimates. These might provide useful first guesses to ProFit fitting parameters (particularly \option{flux}, \option{axrat} and \option{ang}).
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{image}{
Numeric matrix; required, the image we want to analyse. Note, image NAs are treated as masked pixels.
}
  \item{segim}{
Integer matrix; required, the segmentation map of the \option{image}. This matrix *must* be the same dimensions as \option{image}.
}
  \item{mask}{
Boolean matrix; optional, parts of the image to mask out (i.e. ignore), where 1 means mask out and 0 means use for analysis. If provided, this matrix *must* be the same dimensions as \option{image}.
}
  \item{sky}{
User provided estimate of the absolute sky level. Can be a scalar or a matrix matching the dimensions of \option{image} (allows values to vary per pixel). This will be subtracted off the \option{image} internally, so only provide this if the sky does need to be subtracted!
}
  \item{skyRMS}{
User provided estimate of the RMS of the sky. Can be a scalar or a matrix matching the dimensions of \option{image} (allows values to vary per pixel).
}
  \item{magzero}{
Numeric scalar; the magnitude zero point. What this implies depends on the magnitude system being used (e.g. AB or Vega). If provided along with \option{pixscale} then the flux and surface brightness outputs will represent magnitudes and mag/asec^2.
}
  \item{gain}{
Numeric scalar; the gain (in photo-electrons per ADU). This is only used to compute object shot-noise component of the flux error (else this is set to 0).
}
  \item{pixscale}{
Numeric scalar; the pixel scale, where pixscale=asec/pix (e.g. 0.4 for SDSS). If set to 1 (default), then the output is in terms of pixels, otherwise it is in arcseconds. If provided along with \option{magzero} then the flux and surface brightness outputs will represent magnitudes and mag/asec^2.
}
  \item{keyvalues}{
List; header values to be used for the WCS.
}
  \item{sortcol}{
Character; name of the output column that the returned segmentation statistics data.frame should be sorted by (the default is segID, i.e. segment order). See below for column names and contents.
}
  \item{decreasing}{
Logical; if FALSE (default) the segmentation statistics data.frame will be sorted in increasing order, if TRUE the data.frame will be sorted in decreasing order.
}
  \item{rotstats}{
Logical; if TRUE then the \option{asymm}, \option{flux_reflect} and \option{mag_reflect} are computed, else they are set to NA. This is because they are very expensive to compute compared to other photometric properties.
}
  \item{boundstats}{
Logical; if TRUE then various pixel boundary statistics are computed (\option{Nedge}, \option{Nsky}, \option{Nobject}, \option{Nborder} \option{Nmask}, \option{edge_frac}, \option{edge_excess} and \option{FlagBorder}). If FALSE these return NA instead (saving computation time). Note by construction \option{Nedge} = \option{Nobject} + \option{Nsky} + \option{Nborder}. If you want to adjust specifically for \option{Nmask} then \option{Nsky} = \option{Nsky} - \option{Nmask}.
}
  \item{offset}{
Integer scalar; the distance to offset when searching for nearby segments.  
}
  \item{col}{
Colour palette; the colours to map the segment IDs against. This is by default the magnitude using a rainbow palette, going from red for bright segments, via green, to blue for faint segments.
}
  \item{profound}{
List; object of class 'profound'. If this is provided then missing input arguments are taking directly from this structure. As an added convenience, you can assign the profound object directly to the \option{image} input.
}
  \item{cor_err_func}{
Function; the error function between \option{N100} (the number of pixels in the segment) and the relative flux error. Most likely the \option{cor_err_func} output of \code{\link{profoundPixelCorrelation}}.
}
  \item{app_diam}{
Numeric scalar; the diameter in arc seconds to use for circular aperture photometry. This will use the appropriate pixel scale to convert the aperture into image units. The circular aperture photometry is output to columns \option{flux_app} and \option{mag_app} in \option{segstats}. The default of NA means this is ignored (and \option{flux_app} / \option{mag_app} will be NA).
}
  \item{add}{
Logical; should just the segment contours be added to the current image? This allows for complex colouring of different segments to be achieved by adding various overlays.  
}
  \item{sparse}{
Determines whether the image pixels are sparse sampled to speed up plotting. If set to 2 it will only determine every 2nd pixel, and if 3 every 3rd etc. If 'auto' it means it will scale to produce a maximum number of 1,000 pixels on any side (on most monitors this is a fairly useful maximum, and ensures quick displaying of even very large images).  
}
  \item{useRaster}{
If TRUE a bitmap raster is used to plot the segmentation map segments instead of polygons. Setting to TRUE is faster, but it can looks fuzzy (so in that case, set to FALSE).
}
  \item{\dots}{
Further arguments to be passed to \code{\link{magimage}}.
}
}
\details{
\code{profoundSegimStats} provides summary statistics for the individual segments of the image, e.g. properties of the apertures, and the sum of the flux etc. This is used inside of \code{\link{profoundMakeSegim}} and \code{\link{profoundMakeSegimExpand}}, but it may be useful to use separately if manual modifications are made to the segmentation, or two segmentations (e.g. a hot and cold mode segmentation) need to be combined.

The interpretation of some of these outputs will depend a lot on the data being analysed, so it is for the user to decide on sensible next steps (e.g. using the outputs to select stars etc). One output of interest might be \option{flux_reflect}. This attempts to correct for missing flux where segments start colliding. This probably returns an upper limit to the flux since in some regions it can even be double counted if the two sources that have colliding segmentation maps are very close together and similar in brightness, so somewhere between \option{flux} and \option{flux_reflect} the truth probably lies. If you want a better estimate of the flux division then you should really be using the profiling routine of \code{ProFit}.

\code{profoundSegimPlot} is useful when you only have a small number of sources (roughly a few hundred). With more than this it can start to take a long time to make the plot! If you provide keyvalues or an Rfits_image (to \option{image}) then it will be plotted with the WCS overlaid using \code{Rwcs_image}, otherwise it will use \code{\link{magimage}}.

  \item{edge_excess}{Ratio of the number of edge pixels to the expected number given the elliptical geometry measurements of the segment. If this is larger than 1 then it is a sign that the segment geometry is irregular, and is likely a flag for compromised photometry}
  \item{flag_border}{A binary flag telling the user which \option{image} borders the segment touches. The bottom of the \option{image} is flagged 1, left=2, top=4 and right=8. A summed combination of these flags indicate the segment is in a corner touching two borders: bottom-left=3, top-left=6, top-right=12, bottom-right=9.}
  
\code{profoundSegimPlot} is a simple function that overlays the image segments on the original \option{image}. This can be very slow for large numbers (1,000s) of segments because it uses the base \code{\link{contour}} function to draw the segments individually.
